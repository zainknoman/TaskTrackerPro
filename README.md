## Overview

TaskFlow Pro transforms a flat task tracker into a full enterprise-grade work management platform — similar in concept to Jira, ClickUp, or Asana — but running entirely in the browser with **no backend, no build step, and no dependencies**.

All data is persisted in `localStorage` with auto-save every 1.8 seconds. The entire application ships as three files: `index.html`, `app.js`, and `style.css`.

## Architecture

```
Workspace (localStorage)
 └── Projects[]
      ├── Milestones[]
      ├── Sprints[]
      └── Tasks[]
           ├── Subtasks[]
           ├── Dependencies → Task IDs
           ├── Documents[]
           └── Activity[]

Users[]
Notifications[]   (transient, rebuilt from live data)
SavedViews[]
Settings { theme }
```

All entities are linked by string IDs. The state object is the single source of truth — every render function reads from `state.*` and every mutation calls `scheduleSave()` which debounces a `localStorage.setItem` write by 1.8 s.

---

## Getting Started

No build step. No npm install.

```bash
# Clone the repo
https://github.com/zainknoman/TaskTrackerPro.git
cd taskflow-pro

# Open directly in your browser
open index.html
# — or —
npx serve .        # simple static server
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

On first load, TaskFlow Pro seeds four demo projects (Core Banking Upgrade, Mobile App Revamp, KYC Digital Onboarding, UAE Tax Portal) with realistic tasks, milestones, and sprints so you can explore every feature immediately.

To start fresh, open **DevTools → Application → Local Storage** and delete the `taskflow_pro_v3` key, then refresh.

## Views & Navigation

| Key | View | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| `1` | Dashboard | Stats, project overview, upcoming deadlines, team workload |
| `2` | Projects | Grid or list view of all projects |
| `3` | Tasks | Full filterable, sortable task table |
| `4` | Kanban | Drag-and-drop status board |

## Data Model

### Project
```js
{
  id, name, code, description,
  department, client, pm, baTeam,
  status,    // 'active' | 'planning' | 'onhold' | 'completed' | 'archived'
  priority,  // 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'
  startDate, endDate, budget,
  color, tags, createdAt, updatedAt
}
```

### Task
```js
{
  id, title, description,
  projectId, milestoneId, sprintId, parentTaskId,
  priority, status,
  startDate, dueDate,
  ba, assignee,
  estimatedHours, actualHours, progress,
  tags, documents, dependencies,
  subtasks,   // [{ id, title, done }]
  notes, starred, pinned,
  createdAt, updatedAt,
  activity    // [{ time, desc }]

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl/⌘ + K` | Focus global search |
| `Ctrl/⌘ + P` | Open command palette |
| `Ctrl/⌘ + N` | New task |
| `1` – `8` | Switch views |

---

## Import & Export

### Export
Click the **⋯ menu → Export JSON** to download a full backup, or **Export CSV** for a flat spreadsheet-friendly format.

### Import
Click **Import JSON** and select a previously exported `.json` file. This fully replaces the current state including projects, tasks, milestones, sprints, and users.

### JSON Schema
```json
{
  "projects":   [ /* Project[] */ ],
  "tasks":      [ /* Task[]    */ ],
  "milestones": [ /* Milestone[] */ ],
  "sprints":    [ /* Sprint[]  */ ],
  "users":      [ /* User[]    */ ],
  "exportedAt": "ISO 8601 timestamp"
}
```

## Extending the App

The codebase is intentionally monolithic and readable. Key extension points:

**Add a new view:**
1. Add a `<section id="view-myview" class="view">…</section>` in `index.html`
2. Add `myview: renderMyView` to the `renders` map in `switchView()`
3. Add a nav link with `data-view="myview"`

**Add a new field to tasks:**
1. Add the HTML input to the task form in `index.html`
2. Read its value in `saveTask()` and include it in the `data` object
3. Display it in `renderTaskRow()` and `openTaskDetail()`

**Replace localStorage with a backend:**
Swap out `Storage.load()` and `Storage.save()` in `app.js` with `fetch()` calls to your API. The rest of the app is unaffected.
